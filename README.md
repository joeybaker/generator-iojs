# Yoeman Generator for Node projects [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-url]][daviddm-image]

A basic module template, that includes handy git hooks, a release script, es{6,2015} support via babel, and auto-changelog generation.

Here's what you get:

* auto-creates a `package.json`
* auto-creates and keeps your `.npmignore` file up-to-date
* auto-creates a `CONTRIBUTING.md`
* auto-creates a `LICENSE`
* auto-creates a `README.md` with a template that you can fill in
* auto-creates a `.travis.yml` for easy CI
* tests are auto-setup in `tape`, and it uses `smokestack` so you can do browser tests too.
* auto-runs tests and linters before a `git push`, to ensure you can never push bad code
* auto-runs the Node Security Project advisory list against installed node modules before a `git push` to make sure your project is always secure
* adds a release script to automate the headache of releasing a new version. It auto-generates a changelog, runs the tests, bumps the version, pushes to github, and publishes to npm.

## Install
`npm install -g generator-iojs yo`

## Usage
```sh
yo iojs
```

## Developing
To publish, run `npm run release -- [{patch,minor,major}]`

_NOTE: you might need to `sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/node /usr/bin/node` to ensure node is in your path for the git hooks to work_

## Tests
Tests are in [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape). They can be run with `npm test`.

Tests can be run in a loop with `npm run tdd`

### Requirements
* **npm > 2.0.0** So that passing args to a npm script will work. `npm i -g npm`
* **git > 1.8.3** So that `git push --follow-tags` will work. `brew install git`
